I have a basis for my WebView app
It has white bars on the outside of the Webview
Started to implemente an array of Webpages to put the navigation drawer to use
5/10/2017
I abandoned the array of Webpages since the code needs an Icon for each webpage
So far in this week I have implemented my code so that it no longer has any side bars or padding on the outside of the webpage.
New urls now stay within the application
Upon testing my app I found out that changing the screen orientation (vertical/horizontal) refreshed the webpage
I fixed that bug so now it no longer refreshes

Today i Changed the Layout so that the webview is below the tab bar and that nothing is overtop the other
The pressing the Back button now goes to the previous page

Made the toolbar lime green
