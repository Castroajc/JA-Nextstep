5/5/2017 This week I started the writing the code for a webview app and finished it to the extent that it
starts up and displays the website. The biggest struggle so far has been today when android
studio has given me an error with the xml base code. There is also a bug that creates a small
greyish bars on the side of the app that I need to figure out how to get rid of. I have started to 
implement a different method of webview, this method uses an array of strings to create a list of 
website for the navigate drawer. Upon going to Junior Achievementâ€™s website I realize that doing
a webview for my app may not be what they want since in their plan, that I got through email, 
includes a pin function that I have not found on their base website.
